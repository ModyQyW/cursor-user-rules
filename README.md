# My Cursor User Rules

English | [ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡](./README.zh-CN.md)

1. Copy `aapev.md` content.
2. Paste into Cursor user rules.
3. Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰

Please note:

1. You need to install MCP (Check [mcp.json](./mcp.json)) and global packages (`nodejs`, `bun`, `python3`, `fnm`, `uv`, `@antfu/ni`, `tsx`, `rimraf`) yourself.
2. This rule should also be effective for Trae, but it has not been tested.
